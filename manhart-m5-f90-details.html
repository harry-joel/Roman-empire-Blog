    <h2>Roman Republic  (509 BCE – 27 BCE)</h2>
    <p>The Roman Republic (509 BCE – 27 BCE) was established after the overthrow of the monarchy, replacing kings with a system of elected officials, with power held by consuls and the Senate. Early conflicts between the patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (commoners) led to political reforms, including the creation of tribunes and the Law of the Twelve Tables. As Rome expanded its territory, it faced external threats, most notably the Punic Wars against Carthage (264–146 BCE), which cemented Roman dominance over the western Mediterranean. However, internal crises began to plague the Republic, with wealth inequality, social unrest, and the rise of powerful military generals like Marius, Sulla, and Julius Caesar. Civil wars, sparked by power struggles and Caesar's rise to dictatorship, culminated in his assassination in 44 BCE. Following another round of civil wars, Octavian (later Augustus) defeated Mark Antony in 31 BCE and was named the first Roman Emperor in 27 BCE, marking the fall of the Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire. The Republic’s collapse was driven by internal strife, expansion, and the concentration of power in individuals.</p>

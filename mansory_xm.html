    <h2>Caesar Romulus's reign and the Downfall of Roman Empire</h2>
    <p>The fall of the Western Roman Empire traditionally occurred in 476 CE when the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer, marking the symbolic end of ancient Rome's dominance in the West. Odoacer did not replace the emperor with another Roman ruler, but instead declared himself King of Italy, effectively ending the Roman imperial line in the West. This event is seen as the conclusion of centuries of decline, which included economic troubles, military defeats, internal instability, and invasions by various barbarian groups. While the Western Roman Empire collapsed, the Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire, continued to thrive for nearly a thousand more years, preserving much of Roman law, culture, and tradition. The fall of the Western Roman Empire marked a significant shift in European history, leading to the fragmentation of the West into smaller, barbarian-ruled kingdoms, and the start of the Middle Ages.</p>

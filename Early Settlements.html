    <h2>Kingdom of Rome(753 BCE)</h2>
    <p>According to Roman mythology, the city was founded on April 21, 753 BCE by Romulus, the legendary first king of Rome. The myth states that Romulus and his twin brother, Remus, were the sons of the war god Mars and the priestess Rhea Silvia. The twins were abandoned as infants but were miraculously saved and raised by a she-wolf. Later, Romulus killed Remus during a quarrel and went on to found the city of Rome, naming it after himself.From a historical perspective, Rome likely began as a small agricultural settlement in the 8th century BCE, located on the Palatine Hill near the Tiber River in what is now Italy.The early Roman settlement in the 8th century BCE was centered around the Palatine Hill, which offered a strategic and defensible location. Scattered across the slopes of the hill were small oval-shaped huts, made from wooden frames and covered with mud and straw, featuring thatched roofs typical of the period's humble dwellings. Surrounding the settlement were patches of farmland where early Romans cultivated grains like wheat and barley. The nearby Tiber River played a crucial role, providing access to water, transportation, and trade routes. Simple dirt paths connected the settlement to the riverbanks, facilitating movement between the hill and the water. The landscape around the settlement included stretches of forest and rugged terrain, adding a natural barrier for protection. This combination of natural resources and strategic positioning laid the foundation for Romeâ€™s future growth from a small agricultural village into a thriving city.</p>

    <h2>Christianity inside Roman Empire</h2>
    <p>The rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire began in the 1st century CE with the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth and his followers, who spread the message of salvation, love, and faith in one God. Initially, Christians were a small and persecuted minority, as their beliefs clashed with Roman polytheism and the worship of the emperor. However, the religion gradually gained followers, especially among the poor, slaves, and marginalized, offering them hope and a sense of community. By the 4th century, Christianity had grown significantly in influence, and the turning point came under Emperor Constantine, who, after converting to Christianity, issued the Edict of Milan in 313 CE, legalizing the faith and allowing its open practice. This marked the beginning of Christianityâ€™s integration into Roman society. By the end of the 4th century, under Emperor Theodosius I, Christianity became the official state religion of the Roman Empire, further spreading its influence. The church gained political power, shaping laws, culture, and societal values, and ultimately transforming the religious landscape of the empire, leading to the decline of traditional Roman.</p>

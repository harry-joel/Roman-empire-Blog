    <h2>Roman Empire</h2>
    <p>The Roman Empire began in 27 BCE when Augustus became the first Roman Emperor, following the collapse of the Roman Republic. His reign marked the start of the Pax Romana (27 BCE – 180 CE), a period of relative peace, stability, and prosperity that lasted for about 200 years. During this time, the empire expanded its borders, unified its vast territories, and saw advances in infrastructure, law, and culture. A significant moment in the empire’s history came under Emperor Constantine (306–337 CE), who in 313 CE issued the Edict of Milan, legalizing Christianity and ending persecution of Christians. Constantine also moved the empire’s capital to Byzantium, which he renamed Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), solidifying its importance as a cultural and political center. These changes, including the rise of Christianity, shaped the later history of the Roman Empire and its transformation in the East into the Byzantine Empire.</p>
